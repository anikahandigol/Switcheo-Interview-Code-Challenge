1. The filtering and sorting logic is incorrect and inefficient.  The filtering includes balances with amounts less than or equal to 0 which might not be intended. The sorting logic does not handle cases where the priorities are equal and can be simplified.

Solution: Filter balances with a valid priority and amount greater than 0 in the line ```return balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0;```.
For the sorting logic, it has a implified comparison method  using subtraction, which is more concise and easier to understand. It also handles equal priorities in the code.

2. Line 49: Using console.err instead of console.error

Solution: Change to ```console.error(error);```

3. Incorrect Formatting of Amount:
Using toFixed() without specifying the number of decimals.

Solution: Specified decimals in ```formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(2)```

4. Inconsistent use of useMemo and useEffect may lead to performance issues. useMemo is used for a computationally heavy task (sorting), while useEffect handles side-effects (fetching prices).

Solution: Maintain consistent use of hooks for their intended purposes. This aspect is addressed by ensuring proper dependencies and correct usage.

5. line 40: children prop is destructured but not used

Solution: Remove children prop variable in the line.

6. useState and useEffect fom 'react' are not imported, and will cause dependency issues

Solution: Add ```import React, { useState, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';``` statement in the beginning of the code.

7. Including prices in the useMemo dependency array for sorting balances is unnecessary because sorting logic does not depend on prices.

Solution: Remove prices from the dependency array. Dependency array will only be ```[balances]```.
